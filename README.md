# LUMEN Data Science competition

## 2nd Workshop - Feature engineering and simple modelling


- You can find the dataset in question here: [NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) 

- The DataSet needs to be unzipped in the same location as jupyter notebooks with the dir name **CMAPSSData**, otherwise please alter the locations of the dataset in the notebooks.
